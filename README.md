💻 I'm a brazilian Information Systems student and a tech enthusiast with a lifelong curiosity for how things work!  

🌱 Currently learning:  
• Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL  
• Git & GitHub  
• Security fundamentals and logic for system development  
• Basics of AI and Data Processing  
• How to break into tech (and not break down in the process 😅)  

🚀 I’m transitioning from a previous background in Law, Design, and IT support. Now I’m fully committed to building a career in software development - and loving every bug I squash along the way.  

🤝 Open to collaborations on beginner-friendly projects, automations, portfolios, and anything that can help sharpen my skills and contribute to the dev community.
🎯 Interests: Back-end development, systems integration, automation, and applied AI.
🎮 Fun fact: I'm a proud old-school gamer - from Metroid and Mario to Elden Ring and tactical RPGs. My love for games shaped my logical thinking and sparked my passion for tech.

🛠 This repository is a work in progress. Just like software: always updating, never truly finished. 😄
