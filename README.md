👋 Hi, I’m @thuanisc  
💻 I'm a brazilian Information Systems student and a tech enthusiast with a lifelong curiosity for how things work!  

🌱 I’m currently learning:  
• Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL  
• Git & GitHub  
• Security fundamentals and logic for system development  
• Basics of AI and Data Processing  
• How to break into tech (and not break down in the process 😅)  

🚀 I’m transitioning from a previous background in Law, Design, and IT support. Now I’m fully committed to building a career in software development - and loving every bug I squash along the way.  

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects, personal portfolios, automations, or anything that helps me grow as a developer.  
🎯 Interested in: Back-end development, systems integration, automation, and AI applications.  

📫 How to reach me:  
• [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thuanisc/)  
• Email: thuanisc@gmail.com  
• Or through a portal, if you're into fantasy worlds - I'm always game.  

😄 Pronouns: she/her
🎮 Fun fact: I'm a proud old school gamer - from Metroid and Mario to Elden Ring and tactical RPGs. My love for games shaped my logical thinking and sparked my passion for tech.

🧠 I believe in learning by doing, asking "why" one too many times, and building tech that actually makes people’s lives better.
